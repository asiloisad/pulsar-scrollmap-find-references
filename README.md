# scrollmap-find-references

Show find-references markers on the scrollbar.

When a language server highlights references to the symbol under the cursor, this package displays their positions as markers on the scrollmap scrollbar. It automatically disables the built-in scrollbar decoration from `pulsar-find-references` to avoid duplication.
